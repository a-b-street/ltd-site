  any project, but we prefer open source projects with a focus on sustainable
  transportation and land use, and involving co-design between a community and
  government. We have lots of experience working with transportation domain
  experts in government, industry, and academia.

  <p>
    A/B Street Ltd is a one-person consultancy run by Dustin Carlino, who has
    been building open source transportation planning software since 2018. In
    2020 he launched the alpha of
    <a href="/projects/traffic_sim">A/B Street</a> (the company's namesake), a
    gamified traffic simulation rendering OpenStreetMap data in unprecedented
    detail and running entirely in a web browser. He spent the next year
    prototyping more targeted tools like
    <a href="/projects/lab"
      >Ungap the Map and the 15-minute neighbourhood tool</a
    >. He joined the Alan Turing Institute in 2022, built
    <a href="https://od2net.org" target="_blank">od2net</a> and the first
    version of the <a href="/projects/ltn">LTN tool</a>, then joined Active
    Travel England on secondment for two years, building
    <a href="/projects/pyats">Plan Your Active Travel Schemes</a> and
    <a href="/projects/route_check">Route Check</a>. In early 2025, he formed
    A/B Street Ltd to provide full-time software consultancy services, where he
    has built two tools for Sustrans, including the
    <a href="/projects/npw">Network Planning Workspace</a>.
