<h2>About</h2>

<p>
  A/B Street is a traffic simulation game exploring how small changes to roads
  affect cyclists, transit users, pedestrians, and drivers. You can transform
  street parking into a bus lane or fix a slow left turn at a traffic signal,
  measure the effects, then propose actually making the change. A/B Street uses
  game-like elements to gradually introduce all of the features of the
  simulation, with a tutorial and challenge modes.

  <p>
    A/B Street gives you a 2D representation of roads, with as much detail about
    bus/bike/turn/parking lanes, transit stops, traffic signals, and parking
    lots as possible, all from OpenStreetMap.

    Depending on elevation data availability, some areas let you visualize steep
    streets -- because your bike network should be planned accordingly.

    Using external travel demand models, you can explore patterns of where
    people live, work, and shop.

<h2>Simulate</h2>

<p>
  Using some external data about what trips people take on a typical day, you
  can simulate drivers, bicyclists, and pedestrians moving around. Every driving
  trip begins and ends with parking somewhere, which might be easy in suburban
  areas, but harder in cities.

  <p>You can follow individual people and watch them wrestle with problems.</p>

<h2>Edit</h2>

<div class="figure">
  <img src="edit_roads.webp" />
  <p>
    A/B Street lets you change how road space is divided up. You can create
    regular vehicle lanes, bus-only lanes, bike lanes, street parking, and new
    sidewalks. You can either transform existing lanes, or slightly widen/shrink
    the road. You can reverse the direction of lanes, or close them down to
    simulate construction.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can also change how traffic signals work. You can modify the timing if
    you notice left turns need more time, or set up actuated timing, so that the
    green light lasts longer when many vehicles are waiting. You can also change
    which movements are allowed each stage, so you could try out a dedicated
    left turn stage or a pedestrian all-walk/scramble cycle.

<h2>Measure</h2>

<p>
  A/B Street lets you tell data-driven stories about both infrastructure and
  people.

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>
  This project is the idea that started it all and the company's namesake.
  However, the scope of this project was too large, and since 2021, the focus
  has been on more focused projects. Many ideas from here still live on today in
  <a href="..">other projects</a>.
