<p>
  After starting a more analytical tool to study 15-minute neighbourhoods,
  Dustin and the original A/B Street dream team developed a computer game to
  illustrate the impact of land use policies on transportation in a more playful
  way. Though this project had no stakeholder originally commissioning it, this
  has been used in a classroom setting to teach schoolkids about urban planning.
