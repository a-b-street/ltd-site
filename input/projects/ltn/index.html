<h2>About</h2>

<p>
  LTNs are a traffic management measure to stop excessive through-traffic
  cutting through residential streets. The public consultation process on their
  design heavily involves residents, and the LTN tool was created to make the
  process of placing modal filters intuitive and rapidly explorable.

    Start by deciding the boundary of your LTN. In Scotland, you can prioritise
    by factors like population density, car ownership, and land use mix.

    Place new modal filters until a new cell forms, ensuring shortcutting
    traffic does not just reroute a different way through the neighbourhood.

    The LTN tool has gone through several iterations. The first version was
    built in conjunction with Bristol City Council, used in a
    <a

      >liveable neighbourhood consultation</a
    >, which included in-person workshops.

<p>
  The current version, called the Connected Neighbourhood Tool, was developed
  with the
  <a href="https://www.sustrans.org.uk" target="_blank">Sustrans</a> mobility
  team, funded by
  <a href="https://www.transport.gov.scot" target="_blank">Transport Scotland</a
  >. The Scotland version is undergoing internal review before launch, while the
  global version is launched and ready for use. The tool has also benefited from
  significant feedback, testing, and co-design with members of the OpenStreetMap
  community and cycle campaigning volunteers in France. By making a useful tool
  available worldwide and for free, this sort of organic evolution and
  coordination happens.
