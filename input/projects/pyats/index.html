<h2>About</h2>

<p>
  While Dustin was on secondment with
  <a href="https://www.activetravelengland.gov.uk" target="_blank"
    >Active Travel England</a
  >
  (ATE) from 2023 to 2025, he led development of PYATS.

<h2>Sketching schemes</h2>

<p>
  Active Travel England is a central government agency, and needs to review
  proposed schemes from authorities across the country. Authorities vary in
  their technical GIS expertise, and have previously received the geographic
  location of schemes in a variety of incompatible GIS formats, PDF maps, and
  plaintext descriptions, making standardised and automated analysis nearly
  impossible. Dustin developed PYATS to let authorities with any level of GIS
  experience quickly draw schemes in their browser.
</p>

<p>
  The project included a tool to trace routes snapped to existing roads, and
  neighbourhood areas bounded by roads. The
  <a href="https://github.com/dabreegster/route_snapper/" target="_blank"
    >route snapper tool</a
  >
  developed for this is the first known open source approach for doing this
  completely client-side, without a backend routing API. This simplified cloud
  deployment, requiring only to host static files, and keeps the latency while
  drawing absolutely minimal.
</p>
<p>
  This sketch tool has been used by a variety of users to collect over 17,000
  miles of routes, enabling analysis of funded schemes.
</p>

<h2>Browsing schemes with contextual layers</h2>

<p>
  Active Travel England's Inspectorate team reviews proposed schemes, finds
  problems, and teaches guidance to local authorities to improve the designs. To
  do their daily work, they need to consult dozens of different data sources for
  road noise, pollution, census, traffic, collision statistics, and so on. Since
  it's so tedious to switch between many tools and to relate them to sketched
  schemes, Dustin developed the second part of PYATS, bringing together all
  these layers in one place. This streamlines different review processes, seeing
  submitted schemes alongside contextual layers. The specialised UI is much
  faster for the specific Inspectorate tasks than off-the-shelf solutions like
  ArcGIS.
</p>

<p>
  This tool pulls together dozens of public and (internal only) private data
  sources specific to England. The tool makes extensive use of
  <a href="https://docs.protomaps.com/pmtiles/" target="_blank">PMTiles</a>, a
  cloud-friendly vector tile format, to simplify hosting.
</p>

<h2>Working with the stakeholder</h2>

<p>
  Dustin worked directly with the users of PYATS (the Inspectorate and external
  users responsible for sketching schemes). Regular feedback and shared
  co-design sessions let the tool be perfectly fit-to-task. Dustin worked with
  other members of ATE's data and digital team to develop and launch the tool,
  and

  from Methods, who led user experience research and design.
