<a href="..">&larr; Other projects</a>

<p>
  There are many experimental projects related to the vision of freely
  available, easy-to-use urban planning tools in the works. These are some
  projects earlier in development, without a clear audience yet. Some of these
  ideas might make their way to a more full project later. Contact if you want
  to develop any of these further.

<h2>Ungap the Map</h2>

<p>
  A very early cycle network planning tool, letting users explore the trade-offs
  between the direct, usually unsafe route and the quiet, usually slow and hilly
  route, and quickly sketch improvements. This project was built for the 2021
  Taiwan presidential hackathon. It lives on as the
  <a href="/projects/npw">Network Planning Workspace</a>.

<h2>osm2streets</h2>

<p>
  An interpretation of OpenStreetMap data with enough detail to show individual
  lanes and intersections, powering the A/B Street traffic simulation. Very
  useful for checking OSM data quality.

<h2>15-minute neighbourhood tool</h2>

<p>
  Explore the amenities reachable by walking, cycling, public transit, or
  driving.

<h2>Severance Snape</h2>

<p>
  See how big roads without adequately frequent crossings force long detours for
  pedestrians.
</p>

<h2>od2net</h2>

<p>
  Determines the roads that could be used by many potential cycling trips, if
  those roads were made safer. <a href="/projects/npw">NPW</a> builds on this
  idea, using the potential cycling demand in a full network planning process.

<h2>Will it fit</h2>

<p>
  An early prototype developed while on secondment to Active Travel England,
  this tool measures the available space on a street and determines where a
  proposed cycle route could fit.
