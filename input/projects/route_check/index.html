<h2>About</h2>

<p>
  While Dustin was on secondment with
  <a href="https://www.activetravelengland.gov.uk" target="_blank"
    >Active Travel England</a
  >
  (ATE) from 2023 to 2025, he led the digitisation of an
  <a
    href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/active-travel-england-scheme-review-tools"
    target="_blank"
    >Excel route check tool</a
  >. This is used by both the Inspectorate team and external partners to
  evaluate the quality of an active travel route in great detail. The Excel tool
  suffers from some accessibility problems, and the web app uses the
  <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/" target="_blank"
    >GOV.UK design system</a
  >
  to make the tool much faster and easier to use.

    After the user identifies the roads, the Junction Assessment Tool quickly
    generates possible cycling movements. Users map and score every cyclist and
    pedestrian movement through every major junction along the route, and
    automation like this saves dozens of minutes per scheme assessing long
    routes.

<h2>Working with the stakeholder</h2>

<p>
  Dustin worked directly with the the Inspectorate, who use the old Excel tool
  daily. Regular feedback and shared co-design sessions let the tool be
  perfectly fit-to-task. Dustin worked with other members of ATE's data and
  digital team to develop the tool, and

  from Methods, who led user experience research and design.
