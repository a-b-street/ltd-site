<h2>About</h2>

<p>
  The Network Planning Workspace (NPW) is a web app for local authorities to
  plan a cycle network. Users draw routes on the map to form the network,
  starting from primary and secondary tiers that cover potential demand, and
  then filling in local access connections and long-distance routes between
  settlements. By looking at data on speed limit, traffic volume, and available
  street width, NPW automatically picks an appropriate infrastructure type for
  each section of a route. Users can address any constraints where a high Level
  of Service cannot be achieved or where a street is too narrow to fit a
  segregated cycletrack. As the network is built up, NPW displays a variety of
  metrics to judge the performance of the network.

  <p>
    Reviewing the sections along this route, NPW flags a high-speed road where a
    segregated cycletrack is insufficient to achieve a high Level of Service
    without further interventions.

    Despite being close to the primary network, access to a park is severed by a
    road with high traffic volume. NPW automatically recommends a route to
    connect it.

    Based on origin/destination data for commuting, school, and utility trips,
    NPW calculates flow along the drawn network. Thick red and orange segments
    show key connections with inadequate Level of Service, helping a user
    prioritise filling in gaps. Evaluating the trips against the proposed
    network takes only a few seconds in the browser.

<h2>Working with the stakeholder</h2>

<p>
  NPW was built for the
  <a href="https://www.sustrans.org.uk" target="_blank">Sustrans</a> mobility
  team, funded by
  <a href="https://www.transport.gov.scot" target="_blank">Transport Scotland</a
  >. The larger NPT project has been running for a few years with ITS Leeds data
  science, and A/B Street Ltd joined in autumn 2024 to expand a static data
  visualization tool into a first-of-kind interactive network planning tool. It
  was very enjoyable working with Sustrans to turn the network quality metrics
  -- safety, directness, coherence, comfort, and attractiveness -- into specific
  quantifiable measurements that can be recalculated constantly.
  <a href="https://www.cyclestreets.org" target="_blank">CycleStreets Ltd</a>
  led the UX design, and together we transformed a swiss-army-knife tool into
  carefully guided workflows using the
  <a href="https://designsystem.gov.scot/" target="_blank"
    >Scottish government design system</a
  >. The initial feedback from local authorities has been incredibly detailed
  and positive; with just cursory training on the tool, officers have built
  reasonable network plans in an hour or two.
</p>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>
  The initial development phase is finished, and NPW is ready to use. It's
  undergoing a further review process before launch. There are many ideas for
  further polish and expanding its scope. Currently it's limited to Scotland,
  but A/B Street Ltd is available to adapt it elsewhere.
