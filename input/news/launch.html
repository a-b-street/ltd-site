  I formed A/B Street Ltd in late January, and it's now June when I finally have
  time to launch this site and describe to the world what this company is about!

<p>
  My full story starts long ago. In
  <a
    href="https://a-b-street.github.io/docs/project/history/backstory.html"
    target="_blank"
    >2018</a
  >, I left the tech industry to start an impossible project -- make a traffic
  simulation detailed and realistic enough to explore and propose real cycling
  improvements for Seattle, but user-friendly enough that <i>anybody</i> who's
  played some computer games could figure it out. The next
  <a

    target="_blank"
    >three years</a
  >
  were spent both pursuing that vision but also pivoting to simpler, more
  focused ideas -- some of which stuck. I then moved to London, joined the Urban
  Analytics research group at the Alan Turing Institute, and then found an
  opportunity to work with government via a secondment with Active Travel
  England.

  By the end of 2024, I was working on two projects with Sustrans (<a
    href="/projects/npw"
    >Network Planning Workspace</a
  >
  and the <a href="/projects/ltn">Connected Neighbourhood Tool</a>), and forming
  my own limited company made sense. For anybody who has been following my work
  through the years, first of all -- thank you! And second, don't worry, not
  much is changing; <a href="/projects">all of my projects</a> are still totally
  open source and usable by anybody. If you are a local authority, a cycle
  campaigner, or anybody else with an idea I could build or a problem I could
  solve, then <a href="/services">hire me</a>!
</p>

<p>
  In the meantime, I'm working on some really exciting ideas right now, and this
  site is a place where I'll share progress on them. Stay tuned!
